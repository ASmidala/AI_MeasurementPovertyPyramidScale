        PyramidPovertyScale (PPS)

   These Artificial Intelligence has a two phase which are:
   1.	The Measure Page
   2.	The Explore Page

   The Measure is dealing with how you can use it to measure poverty in concept of microeconomics or individual concept meanwhile to provide requirements data the he AI or  ML will decide the status of the person in regard of poverty , and MPI and healthcare status of individual or at whole.
e.g. his income, level of multidimensional poverty index (mpi) and the Healthcare status. 

While the Explore phase is dealing with additional information regarding the status level of poverty using some statistical parameters/experiment and computer vision imagery.
In the phases are follows:
	Mean income of the sample size.
	Standard deviation of their income.
	 Imagery vision) 

All in the boundary of londonciki area of jere local government Borno State

Practically:
 Income = 60,000 Naira
Mpi = 1.0 
Healthcare = 0.5


Mpi range will in decimal point or whole number just your preference
The same with healthcare.

Now the PPS is using MACHINE LEARNING Models Algorithms of prediction and it is determine the outcome through the parameters of statistical Probability. 
The measure/scaling algorithm exactly this way if output is greater than 0.5 then the outcome will be danger line, below the poverty line else it is a safe line, absent of poverty.
