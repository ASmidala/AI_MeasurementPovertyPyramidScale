    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.it involves creating machines that can think, reason learn, and make decisions. It’s like giving computers the ability to be smart and solve problems just like humans do! 
    Machine learning is a field of study that focuses on creating computer systems that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. it’s 
    Like teaching a computer to learn and make decisions on its own.
    PPS is an AI that focuses on measuring poverty in deferent dimension/dynamic of poverty such as monetary, multidimensional and among other threshold with a specification in londonciki area of jere local government of Borno state Nigeria.
    Through parameters of UN in monetary as well as Official Poverty Measurement (OPM) in other variables.



    Processing of PPS
    The primary data collected was dataset purposely for the pps project by the projected in kaggle.com and prepare the data in jupyter notebook environment before analyze and use it in pycharm environment for ready used.
    To access the dataset go to 
   https://kaggle.com  and searched (Londonciki_public_survey.csv)


     Developing the PyramidPovertyScale (PPS)
     Through The use of
     •	Logistic regression thus linear regression 
     •	Dataset
     •	Algorithms 
     •	Probability 
     •	Deployment and production.

    Important of AI (PPS)
    1.	Enhance efficiency: AI-powered systems can automate tasks, reducing human effort and time. This leads to increased productivity and efficiency in various domains.
    2.	Enable better decision-making; I algorithm can analyze vast amounts of data and provide valuable insights, helping to make realistic and unbiased data.
    3.	Improve accuracy: I models can process data with great precision-minimizing errors and improving the accuracy of tasks and data analysis.
    4.	Avoidance of complication data and emotion obstacle: AI ensure to be more precise with outcome like solve the problem duality or abundance data and did not emotion in decision-making meanwhile not like relatives  privileged it just include what is include .
    5.	Drive innovation: AI fosters innovation by enabling the development of new technologies and solutions.it pushes the boundaries of what machines can do and opens up new possibilities.

    Limitations of PPS

    1.	Reliance on algorithms: PPS are only as good as the algorithms and data they are built upon. Biased in algorithms or workforce and the need for new skills.
    2.	Absent of emotions: it concerns only the models work that was developed to performed task accordingly perhaps can skips match important aspect. 
    3.	Perhaps unemployment: if it’s keep working perfectly can reduce the number of human workers in the field because its ensure features that important especially the realistic and unbiased.
    4.	Data collection/dataset processing must be accurate: dataset must be accurate to process to train/testing   or else it will keep generating errors, because is the experience that will use by the AI to do decision-making perhaps in supervised machine learning.


  PyramidPovertyScale (PPS)

     These Artificial Intelligence has a two phase which are:
     1.	The Measure Page
     2.	The Explore Page

     The Measure is dealing with how you can use it to measure poverty in concept of microeconomics or individual concept meanwhile to provide requirements data the he AI or  ML will decide the status of the person in regard of poverty , and MPI and healthcare status of individual or at whole.
  e.g. his income, level of multidimensional poverty index (mpi) and the Healthcare status. 

  While the Explore phase is dealing with additional information regarding the status level of poverty using some statistical parameters/experiment and computer vision imagery.
  In the phases are follows:
  	Mean income of the sample size.
  	Standard deviation of their income.
  	 Imagery vision) 

  All in the boundary of londonciki area of jere local government Borno State

  Practically:
   Income = 60,000 Naira
  Mpi = 1.0 
  Healthcare = 0.5


  Mpi range will in decimal point or whole number just your preference
  The same with healthcare.

  Now the PPS is using MACHINE LEARNING Models Algorithms of prediction and it is determine the outcome through the parameters of statistical Probability. 
  The measure/scaling algorithm exactly this way if output is greater than 0.5 then the outcome will be danger line, below the poverty line else it is a safe line, absent of poverty.
